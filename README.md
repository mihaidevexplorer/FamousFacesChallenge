## Overview

**Famous Faces Challenge** is a fully functional Android application designed to test users' knowledge of celebrities. Leveraging Kotlin, XML, SQLite, as well as Picasso and MPAndroidChart libraries, I crafted this engaging app.

## Key Features

- **Guess the Celebrity**: The app allows users to guess the names of celebrities based on their pictures.
- **Interactive UI**: I designed and implemented the application's user interface (UI), including main screens, game screens, and score screens.
- **Data Storage**: I integrated the SQLite database to store data about celebrities and user scores.
- **Efficient Image Loading**: Using the Picasso library, I efficiently load and display celebrity images.
- **Visualize User Scores**: With MPAndroidChart, I created charts displaying user scores.
- **Thorough Testing**: I carefully tested and debugged the application to ensure it functions correctly and error-free.
